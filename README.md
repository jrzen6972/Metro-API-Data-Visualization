# Metro API Data Visualization

*Tell me what you've gotten done so far, what obstacles you have encountered, and whether/how your plans have changed as you have gotten to work. The writing style can be informal.*

The Metro API Data Visualization project

## Readme format:

*Provide a status update in the readme.md of your project repo (or notebook) that is no more than 250-500 words and includes the following items. This update should be uploaded to your final project repo (do not submit anything to Canvas):*

1. *images of the current interface (rough prototype is fine, but it should be clear you have been able to load part of your data into a static visualization at least). These do not need to be beautiful, just show the progress you've made in getting to a working interface.*
2. *Any modifications to your proposed implementation approach. What libraries have you been using? Has your implementation approach changed significantly? If so, why?*
3. *Features and schedule. How is your project tracking against what you proposed? Are you on schedule? If not, what's blocking you from making progress?*
4. *Your code pushed to the repo (or notebook), with a public-facing link to the interface*
