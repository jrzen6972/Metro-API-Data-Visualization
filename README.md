*Note: there is an issue with Microsoft Game Bar screen recording, where drop-down menus are made invisible in the final recording.*

2.  **Modifications to proposed implementation approach**: *Any modifications to your proposed implementation approach. What libraries have you been using? Has your implementation approach changed significantly? If so, why?*\

4. **Features and schedule**: *How is your project tracking against what you proposed? Are you on schedule? If not, what's blocking you from making progress?*
Currently, we are wortking on:

- Seperating trains by group
- Fitting in the true time somewhere within the visual
- Adding more interativity functions, such as showing rout destinations and outages, to name a few. 

We aim to complete these items in time by the video demo on riday, April 15. As of the writing of this readme, we have no issues with reaching the deadline.
